# sgp4-cpp
This project is a mirror of David Vallado's source code for the cpp version of his SGP4 library.

## Source
This code is retrieved from David Vallado's [software page](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php).
The commit history for this mirror has been reconstructed by layering the historical versions of this library.
It also keeps the original commit date where possible. (Check out the commit history!)

## Hey man, you forgot a file, version, date, etc..!
Please open an issue and the relevant code if possible.
I will update the history of this project to be as realistic as possible.
It is certainly possible that there is something I missed while compiling the commit history for Vallado's code.

Similiarily, if there is an update to the latest SGP4 code, please let me know via opening an issue or contacting me directly.
